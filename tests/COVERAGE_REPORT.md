## Recommendations for Improving Coverage

### 1. Facebook Scraper

- Create more granular tests for individual methods
- Add tests for error handling scenarios
- Mock more browser interactions to test complex flows

### 2. Newegg Scraper

- Continue improving test coverage for complex browser interactions
- Add more tests for error handling and edge cases
- Test product parsing with more varied HTML structures

## Next Steps

1. **Focus on Facebook Scraper**: Prioritize improving the Facebook scraper coverage, targeting at least 30% coverage in the next release.
2. **Add More Integration Tests**: Add additional integration tests to verify that different components work together correctly.
3. **Set Coverage Goals**: Aim for at least 60% coverage for all modules and 90% for critical modules.

## Running Coverage Reports

To generate a coverage report, run:

```bash
./run_tests.py -c
```

For a more detailed HTML report, run:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=scrapers --cov=utils --cov-report=html
```

This will generate an HTML report in the `htmlcov` directory that you can open in a browser for a more detailed view of which lines are covered and which are not.
