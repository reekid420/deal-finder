## Analysis

### Well-Covered Areas

- **eBay Scraper (83%)**: The eBay scraper has good test coverage, with most of the core functionality being tested.
- **Config Module (100%)**: The configuration module is fully covered by tests.

### Areas Needing Improvement

- **Facebook Scraper (12%)**: The Facebook scraper has low coverage due to its complexity and browser automation.
- **Newegg Scraper (15%)**: Similar to the Facebook scraper, the Newegg scraper has low coverage.
- **AI Helper (0%)**: The AI helper module has no test coverage.
- **Location Module (0%)**: The location module has no test coverage.
- **Security Module (0%)**: The security module has no test coverage.

## Recommendations for Improving Coverage

### 1. Facebook and Newegg Scrapers

- Create more granular tests for individual methods
- Add tests for error handling scenarios
- Mock more browser interactions to test complex flows

### 2. AI Helper Module

- Create unit tests for individual AI helper functions
- Mock API responses for testing AI integration
- Test recommendation generation with sample data

### 3. Location Module

- Add tests for location parsing and validation
- Test distance calculation functions
- Test geocoding functionality with mock responses

### 4. Security Module

- Test encryption and decryption functions
- Add tests for authentication flows
- Test rate limiting functionality

### 5. Logging Setup

- Add tests for different logging configurations
- Test log file rotation and cleanup

## Next Steps

1. **Prioritize Critical Functionality**: Focus on adding tests for critical functionality first, especially in the AI helper and security modules.
2. **Improve Browser Automation Testing**: Enhance the mocking of browser interactions to better test the Facebook and Newegg scrapers.
3. **Add Integration Tests**: Add more integration tests to verify that different components work together correctly.
4. **Set Coverage Goals**: Aim for at least 50% coverage for all modules and 80% for critical modules.

## Running Coverage Reports

To generate a coverage report, run:

```bash
./run_tests.py -c
```

For a more detailed HTML report, run:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=scrapers --cov=utils --cov-report=html
```

This will generate an HTML report in the `htmlcov` directory that you can open in a browser for a more detailed view of which lines are covered and which are not.
