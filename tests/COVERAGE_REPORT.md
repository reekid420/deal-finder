## Analysis

### Well-Covered Areas

- **Logging Setup (91%)**: The logging setup module now has excellent coverage.
- **Config Module (100%)**: The configuration module is fully covered by tests.
- **Security Module (89%)**: The security module has excellent coverage.
- **Location Module (87%)**: The location module has strong coverage.
- **eBay Scraper (83%)**: The eBay scraper has good test coverage.
- **AI Helper (68%)**: The AI helper module has good coverage but could be improved.

### Areas Needing Improvement

- **Facebook Scraper (24%)**: The Facebook scraper has improved coverage but still needs more tests.
- **Newegg Scraper (42%)**: The Newegg scraper has improved coverage but still needs more tests.

## Recommendations for Improving Coverage

### 1. Facebook Scraper

- Create more granular tests for individual methods
- Add tests for error handling scenarios
- Mock more browser interactions to test complex flows
- Add tests for session handling and cookie management

### 2. Newegg Scraper

- Continue improving test coverage for complex browser interactions
- Add more tests for error handling and edge cases
- Test product parsing with more varied HTML structures

## Next Steps

1. **Continue Improving Facebook Scraper**: We've improved the Facebook scraper coverage from 18% to 24%, but should continue targeting at least 30% coverage in the next release.
2. **Add More Integration Tests**: Add additional integration tests to verify that different components work together correctly.
3. **Refactor Complex Methods**: Some methods in the Facebook and Newegg scrapers are too complex, making them difficult to test. Consider refactoring these into smaller, more testable units.

## Recent Improvements

- Added comprehensive tests for the `_extract_condition` method in the Facebook scraper
- Added tests for HTML extraction when selectors fail
- Implemented tests for captcha detection and handling
- Added tests for error handling and retry mechanisms
- Added tests for session restoration with invalid cookies
- Overall coverage improved from 49% to 50%

## Running Coverage Reports

To generate a coverage report, run:

```bash
./run_tests.py -c
```

For a more detailed HTML report, run:

```bash
python -m pytest --cov=scrapers --cov=utils --cov-report=html
```

This will generate an HTML report in the `htmlcov` directory that you can open in a browser for a more detailed view of which lines are covered and which are not.
